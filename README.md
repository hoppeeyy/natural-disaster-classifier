This project focuses on using deep learning to automatically classify natural disasters from images with an impressive accuracy of 92%. By analyzing visual patterns in photos, the model can distinguish between various disaster types such as floods, wildfires, earthquakes, and hurricanes.

🔍 Project Highlights:

📸 Image-based classification of natural disasters with minimal human intervention.

🧠 Powered by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained from scratch.

📊 Achieves 92% accuracy on a diverse test set spanning multiple disaster scenarios.

🌍 Ideal for real-time disaster detection in emergency response systems or satellite image processing.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch (whichever framework you used)

NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization

📂 Dataset:

A large, well-balanced dataset consisting of thousands of labeled images across disaster classes:

🌊 Flood

🔥 Wildfire

🌪️ Tornado

🌋 Volcanic Eruption

🌍 Earthquake


🧪 Model Workflow:

Image Preprocessing – Normalization, resizing, and augmentation.
